	"info" "[b]This addon was not made for TTT or DarkRP.[/b]  Included in this addon: Shells from Gamebanana, released under Creative Commons, and WAREZ FREE!  Ammo boxes which can explode if damaged.  Selective Fire: Some weapons can now change between full automanic and semi automatic. Hole Use (default E) and hit Reload to select auto or semi-auto.  [b]Optional Empty Weapon Stripping: Weapons with no ammo left will be dropped. Use the console command M9KWeaponStrip. Weapon stripping is disabled by default, and shame on me for not doing it earlier.[/b]  [b]Optional Gas Effects when firing your weapon. Use the console command M9KGasEffect. If you are using an older computer or lag severely when firing, disable the effect.[/b]  [b]Optional Dynamic Recoil: Recoil now will push your aiming direction. You will notice your aim being pushed upward after each shot. Don't like it? Use the console command M9KdynamicRecoil. [/b]  [b]Optional Bullet Penetration: Disable the penetration and ricochet, as well as their effects. Use the console command M9KDisablePenetration.[/b]  [b]Optional Ammo Box Detonation: You can decide whether my ammo boxes go kaboom or not. Use the console command M9KAmmoDetonation.[/b].  [b]Unique Weapon Slots: Use the console command M9KUniqueSlots if you would like to enable/disable unique slot numbers (and fast weapon switching) for each weapon. (And let me know if I missed one!)[/b]  [b]Customizable Damage Multiplier: Use the console command M9KDamageMultiplier to scale up (or down!) M9K bullet damage.[/b]  [b]Customizable Default Clips: Use the console command M9KDefaultClip to select how many default clips weapons will spawn with.[/b]  This addon does require CSS for hand textures, but you can find a suitable replacement here on the workshop. Garry has also included low-res fallback tectures, so you should be able to play without looking at checkerboard hands.  Included are 19 weapons, listed and credited below.

However, the weapon base is now public, so you can make them yourselves! Visit this link to download the base, and follow the instructions to start making your own weapons. [url=http://murderthon9000.com/bobs-base]Weapon Base download at Murderthon9000.com[/url]  -------------------------------------------------  [b]Problems downloading this addon?[/b]  Are you downloading several addons at once? Unsubscribe and try to download them one at a time.  Do you have a lot of addons installed? If so, you might have hit the lua limit, and you will either have to delete some old addons, or decide whether you want this addon over some of the others.  Sadly, I cannot help with "extraction failed" problems. The best that I can recommend is that you verify the integrity of game cache. Right click on the game in the library, and go to properties>local files>verify integrity of game cache.  If GMod still doesn't want do download the addon, or you would rather have the Legacy addon, visit this link below: [url=http://murderthon9000.com/murderthon-9000-assault-rifles-legacy-pack]Legacy and Server Downloads[/url]  -------------------------------------------------  [b]Problems with sounds?[/b]  First, try verifying the integrity of Gmod's game cache. Right click on the game in the library, and go to properties>local files>verify integrity of game cache.  Next, delete the contents of garrysmod/garrysmod/downloads/server.  If that doen't work, do you have a lot of addons installed? You might have hit the lua limit. See if disabling a few addons does the trick.  If you're recieving a console error stating "attempt to index global 'sound' (a function value)" then another addon has overwritten the sound.play or sound.add function. You will have to find this addon and disable it, or tell that addon's creator to fix the problem. Feel free to tell the addon's creator to leave a message here, I'll be happy to help solve the problem.  Lastly, your addon .gma might be corrupted. Try deleting it from garrysmod/garrysmod/addons. Garry's Mod will redownload it when you start up, OR you can manually replace the addon with the copy you will find above, under Legacy and Server downloads.   [b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231961544]As a last resort, I have updated the old sound files in an addon, which can be found here.[/url] Subscribe to this addon if everything else fails.[/b]"
