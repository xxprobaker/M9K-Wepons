If you are using an older computer or lag severely when firing, disable the effect.[/b]  [b]Optional Dynamic Recoil: Recoil now will push your aiming direction. You will notice your aim being pushed upward after each shot. Don't like it? Use the console command M9KdynamicRecoil.

I don't think I will be making any more weapons. However, the weapon base is now public, so you can make them yourselves! Visit this link to download the base, and follow the instructions to start making your own weapons.

Unsubscribe and try to download them one at a time.  Do you have a lot of addons installed? If so, you might have hit the lua limit, and you will either have to delete some old addons, or decide whether you want this addon over some of the others.  Sadly, I cannot help with "extraction failed" problems. The best that I can recommend is that you verify the integrity of game cache. Right click on the game in the library, and go to properties>local files>verify integrity of game cache.  If GMod still doesn't want do download the addon, or you would rather have the Legacy addon, visit this link below: [url=http://murderthon9000.com/murderthon-9000-small-arms-legacy-pack]Legacy and Server Downloads[/url]  As I have mentioned before, I'm not making any more weapons. However, the weapon base is now public, so you can make them yourselves! Visit this link to download the base, and follow the instructions to start making your own weapons.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=175533593]M9K NPC Weapons[/url]  [b]Problems with sounds?[/b]  First, try verifying the integrity of Gmod's game cache. Right click on the game in the library, and go to properties>local files>verify integrity of game cache.  Next, delete the contents of garrysmod/garrysmod/downloads/server.  If that doen't work, do you have a lot of addons installed? You might have hit the lua limit. See if disabling a few addons does the trick.  If you're recieving a console error stating "attempt to index global 'sound' (a function value)" then another addon has overwritten the sound.play or sound.add function. You will have to find this addon and disable it, or tell that addon's creator to fix the problem. Feel free to tell the addon's creator to leave a message here, I'll be happy to help solve the problem.  Lastly, your addon .gma might be corrupted. Try deleting it from garrysmod/garrysmod/addons. Garry's Mod will redownload it when you start up, OR you can manually replace the addon with the copy you will find above, under Legacy and Server downloads.   [b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231961544]As a last resort, I have updated the old sound files in an addon, which can be found here.[/url] Subscribe to this addon if everything else fails.[/b]"
